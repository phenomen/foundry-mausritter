# Features:
## Styled character sheets
Character, Creature, and NPC sheets were built to resemble the standard print sheets.


## Draggable & Transferrable Item Cards
Inventory is handled through item cards, which can be moved around freely, moved between sheets, or copied with CTRL+Drag.

Cards are styled to resemble the official game cards, with automated rolls, usage dots, and more being included.

For usage, left click the dots to increase, and right click to decrease. You can also swap medium weapon damage between one handed and two by clicking the damage value.

## Item Compendiums
Every Item, Weapon, Condition, and Spell from the game has been included inside of the system's compendiums.

## Storage Sheets with Adjustable Dimensions
Have a cart, chest, bank, etc that players want to store items in? Or maybe you have a treasure horde that you want to allow players to peruse through. You can create 'Storage' actors with adjustable slot counts.

## Automated Skill Rolls
You can roll your stats using the built in advantage/disadvantage system

## Macro Support for Weapons, Items, and Skills
For items, you can simply drag them into the hotbar, or use this script:

```
game.mausritter.rollItemMacro("itemName");
```
For Skills, create a new macro with this
```
game.mausritter.rollStatMacro();
```
